Create automated campaigns that will check for new recipients at any specified interval (e.g. birthdays, abandoned shopping carts, order confirmation).

There are no hidden cost, no sign-ups etc; this extension runs completely in your Magento instance. Though a donation is always appreciated :)

This project is currently in an early beta release, but it is already quite powerful. My focus during development was three-fold:

* **Easy to use.** Very little coding (or even no coding) is required. Most tasks can be accomplished without any coding experience. This makes it great for marketing professionals who donâ€™t want to deal with the hassle of coding.
* **Flexible and open.** With a minimum of skills, you can take things a step further and create even more powerful and personalised campaigns. As a developer you can extend and improve your campaigns in order to create custom functionality to suit your needs.
* **Strong reporting.** Collecting data is great, but using it is better. Top-knotch analytics are important for determining if a campaign works or not. I will try my best to aggregate the data and present it in a way that makes sense to the largest number of people possible.
